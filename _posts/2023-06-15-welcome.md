Hi there! I'm David 'DKesserich' Lejeune. I'm a long time jobbing game dev and this is my brand new Github blog. 
In the distant past I used to do some gamedev related blogging on Tumblr, but I feel like Github is a better place for the more technically oriented blogging that I've felt like doing more recently.
